# CSE499_Nearest Neighbour of Different Image Representation
##This project presents a system that utilizes pretrained models and feature extraction 
techniques to identify similarities between images from different domains. Collecting a diverse 
dataset and computing feature vectors, the system measures distances using both Euclidean 
distance and cosine similarity. The retrieval system returns the top 10 images with the highest 
similarity scores, revealing hidden connections and showcasing the potential for cross-domain 
image similarity. This work has applications in content-based image retrieval, cross-domain 
analysis, and creative exploration.
